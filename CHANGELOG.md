## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

ClassificationMatrix as named rows.
Each row is independently readable and testable.
NA→IGN CONVENTION block added at top of Transform/Core.lean.

Non-Collapsing def linked to paper:

1. A lemma noncollapse_of_prs_difference.
   If one profile classifies t as PRS and the other doesn't,
   they are non-collapsing.
   Operative step in every paper proof.

2. A note that for the 9 profiles, every matrix difference
   that appears in a proof involves a PRS cell for
   one of the profiles, so Lean definition is sufficient.

Scaffolding and verification for:

- .\reference\index.toml
- .\reference\proof-registry.json
- .\reference\regime-classification-matrix.toml
- .\reference\regime-classification-values.toml
- .\reference\regime-families.toml
- .\reference\regime-predicates.toml

- .\reference\regime-profiles.toml
- .\reference\regime-theorems.toml

- `reference.py` - scaffold and validate reference artifacts against
  Lean 4 source
- `se-ref-scaffold` CLI command - adds stubs for new Lean symbols,
  preserves existing descriptions and cite_ids
- `se-ref-validate` CLI command - validates reference artifacts
  against Lean source, writes nothing
- `se-manifest-validate` and `se-manifest-version-sync` CLI entry points

### Changed

- README.md workflow commands
- pyproject.toml [project.scripts]
- `run_validate()` extended to include reference artifact validation
  as final step
- Release procedure simplified and updated to use CLI entry points.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added curated public Lean surface via `IdentityRegimes.Surface`.
- Added single downstream import boundary:

  ```lean
  import IdentityRegimes
  open IdentityRegimes
  ```

- Added public exports for:
  - `Regime`
  - `RegimeProfile`
  - `RegimeProfileKind`
  - `Requirement`
  - `Transformation`
  - `TransformationClassification`
  - `IsCanonicalRegime`
  - `IsPreserving`
  - `IsBreaking`
  - `NonCollapsing`
  - `ProfileWellFormed`
  - `RequirementSatisfied`
  - `RegimeApplicationAdmissible`
  - `classify`
  - `derivedRegimeSet`
  - `classification_pattern_unique`
  - `nine_regime_lower_bound`

reference/ files (manual creation / Lean checking):

- regime-classification-values.toml
- regime-families.toml
- regime-profile-derivation.toml
- regime-profiles.toml
- regime-transformations.toml

### Changed

- Migrated Identity Regimes from the previous Neutral Substrate API
  to new public `NeutralSubstrate` import surface.
- Replaced legacy substrate references with `Ontology`.
- Replaced ontology-level `Admissible` usage with `Neutral`.
- Renamed transformation classification vocabulary to `TransformationClassification`.
- Clarified distinction between:
  - six canonical `Regime` values
  - nine derived `RegimeProfileKind` values
  - structured `RegimeProfile` objects

### Fixed

- Fixed Lean theorem binders incorrectly treating `Neutral S` as a typeclass.
- Fixed recursive proof error in `regime_application_admissible_of_neutral`.
- Corrected public surface exports to include only valid, stable identifiers.
- Restored successful `lake build` after Neutral Substrate interface migration.

### Notes

This release establishes a stable public Lean interface for identity-regime theory.

- the canonical classification matrix may be refined
- the reference certification layer may expand

### Design constraints recorded

- Six regimes and nine profiles are distinct layers; profiles refine regimes, they do not replace them
- Semantic richness lives inside Lean only; no Python validation surface
- No operational or export layer in theory repos
- OCC/AD classified as BRK; OBL/BF as IGN; REC/BF as PRS: decisions recorded in SE-300 Section 4

## Notes on versioning and releases

- We use **SemVer**:
  - **MAJOR** - breaking changes to artifact structure or validation semantics
  - **MINOR** - backward-compatible additions to schema or validation rules
  - **PATCH** - fixes, documentation, tooling
- Versions are driven by git tags. Tag `vX.Y.Z` to release.
- Docs are deployed per version tag and aliased to **latest**.

## Release Procedure (Required)

Follow these steps exactly when creating a new release.

### Task 1. Update release metadata (manual edits)

1.1. CITATION.cff: update version and date-released
1.2. lakefile.toml: update version
1.3. CHANGELOG.md: add section, move unreleased entries, update links

### Task 2. Sync and Validate

Sync reads `CITATION.cff` version and `date-released`
and updates `pyproject.toml` fallback-version.

```shell
uv run se-manifest-version-sync
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade
uv run se-validate --strict
git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files
uv run python -m pyright
uv run python -m pytest
uv run python -m zensical build
```

### Task 3. Commit, tag, push

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "Prep X.Y.Z"
git push -u origin main
```

Verify actions run on GitHub. After success:

```shell
git tag vX.Y.Z -m "X.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### Task 4. Verify tag consistency

```shell
uv run se-validate --require-tag
```

Confirms CITATION.cff version matches the pushed git tag.
Run this after `git push origin vX.Y.Z`; it will fail before that point.

## Only As Needed (delete a tag)

```shell
git tag -d vX.Z.Y
git push origin :refs/tags/vX.Z.Y
```
