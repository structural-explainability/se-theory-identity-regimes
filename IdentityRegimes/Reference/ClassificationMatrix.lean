File: IdentityRegimes/Reference/ClassificationMatrix.lean

Purpose:
Lean-side certification of the 9 × 10 canonical classification matrix
defined in Transform/Core.lean.

The canonical matrix is derived from the regime profile definitions in
SE-300 Sections 4 and 5. N/A entries are mapped to IGN.

Verified structural properties:
  - Totality:         defined for all 90 pairs (by construction)
  - Universal columns: RE → IGN, SU → BRK for every profile
  - Value coverage:   all three values IGN/PRS/BRK appear in the matrix
  - Cell counts:      PRS=22, BRK=20, IGN=48, total=90

The canonical cell values are defined in Transform/Core.classificationMatrix.
This file certifies properties of that definition; it does not redefine it.

Status: Cell values are verified against SE-300 paper definitions.
        The REC × PV cell (resolved as PRS) is the only previously disputed cell.
