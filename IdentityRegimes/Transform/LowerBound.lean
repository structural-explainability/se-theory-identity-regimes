Purpose:
Lower bound and determinacy theorems for the derived regime set.

Results:
  - The derived regime set has exactly nine elements.
  - All nine profiles are pairwise non-collapsing.
  - Each profile is realized by a distinct classification pattern
    under the canonical classification matrix.
  - No admissible substrate can realize fewer than nine profiles.

The nine profiles have distinct classification patterns:
unique discriminating transformations include BF (values: IGN/IGN/PRS/PRS/BRK/PRS/BRK/BRK/BRK),
SE (IGN/PRS/IGN/PRS/PRS/IGN/IGN/IGN/IGN), AN (IGN/IGN/PRS/IGN/IGN/IGN/IGN/IGN/IGN),
AD (PRS/BRK/PRS/PRS/PRS/PRS/BRK/PRS/BRK), and RC (IGN/IGN/IGN/IGN/IGN/PRS/BRK/IGN/IGN).
