Purpose:
Regime-typed multigraph embedding and representation theorem.

The embedding sends each identity carrier to its equivalence class
under its unique regime profile. Uniqueness follows from
classification_pattern_unique applied to classificationMatrix.
The representation theorem states that every identity carrier in an
admissible ontology is realized by exactly one profile in the derived
regime set.
